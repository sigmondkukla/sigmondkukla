                        AssemBLOCKS is a teaching tool for assembly language programming that leverages the hands-on,
                        interactive nature of virtual and augmented reality to introduce students to the fundamentals of
                        computer engineering and low-level programming.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I presented AssemBLOCKS at the Faculty Seminar on “Virtual Reality in Teaching and Research,”
                        hosted by Clarkson University in collaboration with the Associated Colleges of the St. Lawrence
                        Valley on December 13, 2024.<br>
                        At the seminar, I also had the chance to demo AssemBLOCKS for faculty and students, showcasing
                        its potential as part of a high school curriculum, which I am excited to continue developing in
                        the future to further experiment with VR for education.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Built using the Unity game engine, I chose to emulate in C# the complete 6502 microprocessor
                        used in computers such as the Commodore 64 and Apple II. AssemBLOCKS simplifies the daunting
                        cross-disciplinary complexity
                        of building a microcontroller by representing data lines as intuitive cable connections between
                        components,
                        allowing users to build a deeper understanding of low-level programming, memory management and
                        communication protocols
                        through a hands-on block diagram of the computer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The simplicity of connecting computer components allows students to go in-depth in programming
                        the computer, and I
                        included both an opcode-based machine code editor and an assembly language editor that put the
                        best features of block
                        programming to good use in making assembly accessible to a wider audience.
